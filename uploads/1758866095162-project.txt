Approach & Design:
- I started by breaking down requirements into 3 endpoints: /upload, /evaluate, /result.
- I used Express.js as backend framework.
- File upload handled with Multer, with support for PDF/DOCX/TXT.
- Text extraction handled with pdf-parse and mammoth libraries.
- I simulated async evaluation pipeline using setTimeout.
- For scoring, I mocked AI responses but structured the code so real OpenAI API can be integrated later.

Results & Reflection:
- File extraction and API endpoints work correctly.
- Evaluation pipeline runs asynchronously and returns structured JSON.
- The AI part is mocked due to API limitation, but design is extendable.
- With more time, I would integrate OpenAI API and a vector DB for RAG.

Future Improvements:
- Real AI integration.
- Persistent storage with MongoDB/Postgres.
- Authentication and security for file upload.
- Dockerized deployment.
